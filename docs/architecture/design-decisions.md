# Architecture Decisions for Notes App MVP

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for Notes App MVP.  
The application MVP will support CRUD operations, include a markdown editor, and offer user account management.  
Choices are driven by the need for fast development, robust performance, and future scalability.

## 1. Frontend Framework: Next.js

**Rationale:**  
Next.js offers rapid development alongside powerful features like **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to optimize page load times. Its seamless integration with **Vercel** further simplifies deployment.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Vite React:** Excellent for building UI components but lacks robust SEO support.
- **Electron + React:** Introduces unnecessary complexity for an MVP.
- **Vue.js:** A viable option; however, our familiarity with React speeds up development.
- **React SPA:** Limited SEO capabilities and slower content loading make it less suitable.
- **SvelteKit:** Offers strong performance and SSR support but has a smaller ecosystem compared to React.
- **Astro:** Optimized for content-heavy sites and supports multiple frameworks but might not be ideal for a dynamic app.

## 2. Backend Framework: Nest.js

**Rationale:**  
Nest.js utilizes a **modular architecture** and comes with **TypeScript support** out of the box, which aligns with our goal to maintain a consistent development environment. Its structured approach ensures that the backend remains scalable and maintainable.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Express.js:** While lightweight and flexible, it lacks the rigorous architectural structure needed for our project.
- **Python FastAPI:** Powerful and fast, but introducing another language (*Python*) could slow development and increase complexity.
- **Koa.js:** A minimalist alternative to Express, but requires more manual setup for middleware and structure.
- **Django (Python):** A full-featured framework but introduces complexity and a new language.
- **Go Fiber:** Extremely fast and efficient, but TypeScript is preferred for consistency across the stack.
- **Spring Boot (Java):** Scalable and enterprise-grade, but overkill for an MVP and introduces another language.

## 3. Data Management: ORM (TBD)

**Rationale:**  
Using an ORM (such as **Prisma** or **TypeORM**) can simplify database interactions and ensure **type safety** across the application.  
Final decisions will be based on the specific data needs and developer familiarity.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Direct SQL or NoSQL Drivers:** Might offer more control but could increase development time and complexity for an MVP.

---

## 4. Content Format: Markdown

**Rationale:**  
Markdown is a **lightweight, widely used markup language** that is easy to parse and render.  
It is ideal for a notes application, allowing users to focus on content creation without being distracted by complex formatting.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **HTML:** More verbose and complex to store and convert.
- **WYSIWYG Editors:** Adds unnecessary complexity for an MVP and may hinder development speed.

## 5. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) (TBD)

**Rationale:**  
Implementing DTOs will help structure data transfers between the client and server, enhancing **maintainability** and ensuring **type safety**.  
This approach is beneficial for future scalability and clarity in the codebase.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Direct Data Models:** Could work for a simple MVP, but might lead to complications as the project grows.

## 6. Security Measures

**Implemented Measures:**
- **Password Encryption:** All user passwords will be securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (**JWT**) will be utilized for stateless, secure user authentication.
- **CORS:** **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** policies will be enforced to protect API endpoints.

---

## Summary

Our architecture for the **Notes App MVP** is designed to balance **rapid development** with **performance and scalability**.  
By leveraging **Next.js** for the frontend and **Nest.js** for the backend within a unified **TypeScript** ecosystem, we ensure a **maintainable and efficient solution**.
