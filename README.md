# Recipes full stack

Welcome to the repository for my fullstack project! This project integrates a modern frontend with a robust backend, powered by PostgreSQL and containerized using Docker.

## Overview

This modern web application is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Frontend:** Developed with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and maintained with ESLint and Prettier. 
- **Backend:** Located in the `backend` directory (details to be updated as development progresses).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for reliable data storage.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose are used for seamless deployment and development.
